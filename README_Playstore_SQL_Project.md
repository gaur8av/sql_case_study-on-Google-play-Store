## Business Tasks & SQL Solutions

### üß† Task 1: Identify Top 5 Categories for Launching Free Apps

**Objective:** Based on average ratings, find the top categories for launching new free apps.

```sql
SELECT Category, AVG(Rating) AS avg_rating 
FROM playstore 
WHERE Type = 'Free' 
GROUP BY Category 
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

---

### üí∞ Task 2: Top 3 Revenue-Generating Categories from Paid Apps

**Objective:** Identify categories with the highest total revenue (Price √ó Installs).

```sql
SELECT Category, AVG(Revenue) AS avg_cat_rev 
FROM (
    SELECT *, (Price * Installs) AS Revenue 
    FROM playstore 
    WHERE Price != 0
) t 
GROUP BY Category 
ORDER BY avg_cat_rev DESC 
LIMIT 3;
```

---

### üìä Task 3: Calculate Percentage of Apps in Each Category

**Objective:** Understand category distribution for business decisions.

```sql
SELECT *, (cnt / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM playstore)) * 100 AS percentage 
FROM (
    SELECT Category, COUNT(App) AS cnt 
    FROM playstore 
    GROUP BY Category
) t 
ORDER BY percentage DESC 
LIMIT 3;
```

---

### üì± Task 4: Recommend Free or Paid App by Category Based on Ratings

**Objective:** Should the company launch free or paid apps per category?

```sql
WITH t1 AS (
    SELECT Category, ROUND(AVG(Rating), 2) AS free_avg_rating 
    FROM playstore 
    WHERE Type = 'Free' 
    GROUP BY Category
),
t2 AS (
    SELECT Category, ROUND(AVG(Rating), 2) AS paid_avg_rating 
    FROM playstore 
    WHERE Type = 'Paid' 
    GROUP BY Category
)
SELECT *, 
       IF(paid_avg_rating > free_avg_rating, 'Develop Paid App', 'Develop Unpaid App') AS Decision 
FROM (
    SELECT a.Category, free_avg_rating, paid_avg_rating 
    FROM t1 a 
    INNER JOIN t2 b 
    ON a.Category = b.Category
) p;
```

---

### üîê Task 5: Track Unauthorized Price Changes Using Triggers

**Objective:** Implement a trigger to monitor and log price changes.

```sql
CREATE TABLE pricechangelog (
  app VARCHAR(255),
  old_price DECIMAL(10,2),
  new_price DECIMAL(10,2),
  operation_type VARCHAR(255),
  operation_date TIMESTAMP
);

DELIMITER //
CREATE TRIGGER log_price_update 
BEFORE UPDATE ON playstore 
FOR EACH ROW 
BEGIN
  IF OLD.Price != NEW.Price THEN
    INSERT INTO pricechangelog 
    VALUES (OLD.App, OLD.Price, NEW.Price, 'UPDATE', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
  END IF;
END;
//
DELIMITER ;
```

---

### üîÅ Task 6: Restore Price After Hack from Logged Data

**Objective:** Use backup log table to restore original prices.

```sql
UPDATE playstore p
JOIN pricechangelog pc ON p.App = pc.app
SET p.Price = pc.old_price
WHERE pc.operation_type = 'UPDATE';
```

---

### üìà Task 7: Correlation Between Ratings and Reviews

**Objective:** Explore if highly rated apps also have more reviews.

```sql
SELECT Rating, Reviews 
FROM playstore 
WHERE Rating IS NOT NULL AND Reviews IS NOT NULL;
-- Use visualization tools like Excel/Power BI to plot correlation
```

---

### üßπ Task 8: Clean Genres Column (Split Multi-Genre)

**Objective:** Split genres like "Action;Adventure" into two separate columns.

```sql
SELECT 
    App,
    Category,
    TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(Genres, ";", 1)) AS Genre_1,
    TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(Genres, ";", -1)) AS Genre_2
FROM playstore;
```

---

### üîé Task 9: Dynamic Tool to Find Underperforming Apps by Category

**Objective:** Create a query to fetch apps with ratings below average for a given category.

```sql
SELECT App, Rating 
FROM playstore 
WHERE Category = 'GAME' 
AND Rating < (
    SELECT AVG(Rating) 
    FROM playstore 
    WHERE Category = 'GAME'
);
```

---

### üß† Task 10: Explain Duration Time vs Fetch Time

**Duration Time:** Total time taken to complete the SQL query execution.

**Fetch Time:** Time taken to return data from buffer/cache to the client.
